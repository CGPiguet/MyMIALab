1) Effect of tree depth
The more the number of depths is increased the more the percentage of accuracy increases for the trainng/test.
The more you increase the depth, the more you obtain a sequence of lines to differentiate the 2 classes of points.
	
2) Effect of the number of trees
The number of trees seems to enlarge the shade area on the line that differentiates the 2 classes of points. It doesn't seem to influenze the accuracy alone but with an higher depth we obtain a better curve for the discrimination and a better accuracy. 
		

3) Parameter tuning
A depth of 10 seems to be a good choice. For a fixed tree value of 50 and a depth of 10, the accuracy of 100% and 95% is obtained for training and testing.
If the depth is increased to 15 or decreased to 5, the accuracy obtained is smaller. 
The number of trees was set at 50 because it is at this value that the accuracy of the training was closest to 100% at each test but the differences are small with smaller values (40.30) or larger ones (60.70). The limit values seem to me to be at these values.
